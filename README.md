# pythonprojects
Here is some projects that I have been doing to practice my Python skills and maintain my progress.

I'm starting my career in the development area and I picked Python to do it. Since I'm in the beginning, I'll post some projects that I'm working on during my journey.

Hope you enjoy and I'm open to talk about this brand new world (at least for me)!
